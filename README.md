# Project README: Process Design Document - Calculate Client Security Hash

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Document

The Process Design Document outlines the business processes selected for automation using UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology. It details the sequence of steps involved in the process, along with conditions and prerequisites for automation. This document serves as a foundational guide for developers to gather necessary details for automating the identified business process.

### 1.2 Objectives

The process chosen for automation is part of a larger project initiative within ACME Systems Inc., specifically in the Finance and Accounting department. The objectives of this automation include delivering faster processing, reducing redundant activities, and enhancing overall performance and reliability.

### 1.3 Process Key Contacts

This section includes essential contacts related to the process, such as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and reviewers/owners responsible for process exceptions and approvals.

## 2. AS IS Process Description

### 2.1 Process Overview

This section provides general information about the process selected for RPA implementation, including details such as process name, function, department, and a brief description of the process.

### 2.2 Detailed Process Map

A comprehensive breakdown of the chosen process, detailing each step required for automation. This includes specific actions, inputs, outputs, and exceptions.

### 2.3 Detailed Process Steps

A complete set of steps in the process, including descriptions, expected results, and screenshots where applicable. Sensitive information may be masked for security purposes.

### 2.4 Exceptions Handling

Identification of known exceptions throughout the automation process and the expected actions for each scenario.

### 2.5 Error Mapping and Handling

A consolidated list of errors, warnings, or notifications encountered during automation, along with actions to be taken by the robot.

### 2.6 In-Scope Application Details

A list of applications used in the automated process, including versions, languages, login modules, interfaces, and access methods.

## 3. Development Details

### 3.1 Prerequisites for Development

Requirements for development and testing environments, including access permissions and system/application replicas.

### 3.2 Password Policies

Details regarding password management policies for users.

### 3.3 Credentials and Asset Management

Guidelines for storing login details and credentials securely.

## 4. Document Approval Flow

A flowchart depicting the approval process for the document, including roles and signatures.

## 5. Appendix

### 5.1 UiPath Automated Process Details

Details about the completed automation process, including overview, robot types, level of human intervention, use of Orchestrator, exceptions, challenges, lessons learned, process assumptions, input data assumptions, data conversion/formatting, and reporting mechanisms.
